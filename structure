what is structure 
    it is hetrogeniyas  we can store different data type datas
    structure is user define data type  it just a data type
    store different different data type variable grouped together and under single name
    basic for linked list like dsa cconcept
    it just template only this will show  to compiler how the structure is they layout
    doesnot occupy memory not allocate when ever we create     struct studet s1  then only memory allocate for struct

 how to declare
     struct student(it is tag and it is optional){
     int r,
     char b,
     float c,
     };

  rules
     semicolon is important in end of the struct
     variable name shouldn't same
     shouldn't define inside the struct int a=90; wrong
     
DECLARING VARIABLE /OBJECT OF STRUCTURE
         struuct student s1;    or   struuct student s1,s2;
         or
        struct {
        int r,
        char b,
        float c,
        }s1,s2;(2 objects names arre s1,s2)   if we use this type we canot create object in main function like   struuct student s1; and we cant add extra elements in structure


INITALIZATION & ACCESSING  OF STRUCTURE
        compile time initalization
        runtime initalization

    i)compile time initalization
    struct studet {
        int r,
        char b,
        float c,
        }; or we can initalize here also  s1={1,'g',8.6},....;
        void main(){
        struct student s={1,'b',5.4}; //data type order should be same based on structure    if we didnot initalize it allocate 0 for int 0.0 for sloat null for string
         printf("%d",s.r);
        }

      struct s;
      struct s2={}
      s=s2 //it can copy the value if both data types are same only its appplicable
      individual element can compare but whole struct doesnot compare   like(s1<s2)

  ii)RUNTIME 
         using scanf
         scanf("%d",&s.r);

//-----------------------------  ARRAY OF STRUCTURE    ---------------------------------------------------//
 if we want to many datas means we move to this type
 
        struct studet {
        int r,
        char b,    // these are structure members
        float c,
        };
        struct student s[80];   // structure variable  it holds 80 datas  (size =80)

         accessing ===>   s[0].r

// -------------  pointer to structure  ------------------------------//
