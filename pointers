pointers
    it is special variable store address of another variable and pointing to the variable
    int *ptr   [* dereference operator or indirect operator]
    always contain address
    it is derived data type
OPERATORS:
     int* p -> p is pointer which have address of integer type of data type
     pointer also have address for self   
SIZE:    
    (Pointer size is depend on machine 
      in 16 bit compiler --> 2 byte
      in 32 bit compiler --> 4 byte
      in 64 bit compiler --> 16 byte)  
DECLARATION:
     int* p;
INITALIZATION
     P=&a;( & address of operator or reference operator)
   
  EXAMPLE:

      i) int *p;
      p=(&a,&b) means it store the b  address of the variable
      p=&a,&b means it atore the a e address
      
      ii) we can access pointer as
        *p or *(&p)
        
     iii) 
     int a=10,b=5;
     int *p=&a;
     *p=*q it is illegal   showing error

     int *p=&a;
     int *q=*b;
     *p=*q is legal 

      float *p=&a     / error illegal a is int type /

//-----------------------     DOUBLE POINTER ---------------------  \\  
    pointer pointing to another pointer (pointer to pointer)
    int *p=a (pointer to variable)
    int **q=&p (pointer to pointer)
    int ***r=&q
    int ***r =&p ---> it illegal it cant acces more than one level
    int *q=25 ----> it is illegal because  *(&q)  it pointing to *p .*p contains a address we cant change the address into integer **q=25 is possibile
    int **q=&a ----> illegal

//----------------------------- POINTER ARITHMETIC --------------------------\\
uncrement /decrement/ adddition  /sub / comparision  
ADD:
  int  a=8,b=9;
  int *p=&a,*q=&b;
  *p+*q is illegal **
   p=p+2; legal   (adress of a + size(2)*) now address is changed
    
   int a[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; 
   int *q=&a[0]
   q=q+2; now pointing [0+2] 3 

SUB:
  we can subtract between pointers and integer also it means when we use in same array and there is no use of finding 2 different array
    int a[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; 
    int *p = a // it pointing first element in array
   int *q=&a[3]
   int *p=&a[0];
   d=q-p 4-1=3;  //it sub between value
   q=q-2 // it sub between  address
